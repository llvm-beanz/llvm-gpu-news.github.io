Welcome to LLVM GPU News, a bi-weekly newsletter on all the GPU things under the LLVM umbrella.
This issue covers the period from February 11 to February 24 2022.

We welcome your feedback and suggestions. Let us know if we missed anything interesting, or want us to bring attention to your (sub)project, revisions under review, or proposals. Please see [the bottom of the page](https://llvm-gpu-news.github.io/about/) for details on how to submit suggestions and contribute.


## Industry News and Community Events


##  LLVM and Clang

### Discussions

*  Alessandro Fanfarillo asked for feedback on adding a [new Clang/LLVM flag to print AMDGPU register usage of HIP kernels](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/feedback-on-new-flag-for-amdgpu/60407). One possibility is to use `-Rpass-analysis=` to activate this functionality. Alessandro shared a draft implementation, [D95063](https://reviews.llvm.org/D95063).
*  Badhi asked about missing [CUDA support for variadic functions in clangd/Clang](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/cuda-cuda-device-code-does-not-support-variadic-functions-in-clang/60481). Artem Belevich explained that [early version of PTX did not support variadic functions on GPU](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/cuda-cuda-device-code-does-not-support-variadic-functions-in-clang/60481/2).

## OpenMP (Target Offloading)

### Discussions

*  LLVM GPU Working Group Meeting on February 18: initial work done towards OpenMP interoperability with other languages (e.g., CUDA, HIP) by [porting them to use the new driver](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QXKSdBWhLaUHyrI-dgd2yHMux3w_q2EF2sROyO0u52k/edit?usp=sharing). An initial proof-of-concept is in development at [D120273](https://reviews.llvm.org/D120273).

### Commits

*  Added the `-fopenmp-offload-mandatory` to remove host-fallback code. [D120353](https://reviews.llvm.org/D120353)
*  Added the `-fopenmp-assume-no-thread-state` to statically remove thread-states in the device runtime. [D120106](https://reviews.llvm.org/D120106)
*  Support for offloading to the CPU added to the new driver. The new driver now passes 100% of the test suite. [D119613](https://reviews.llvm.org/D119613)
*  The new offloading driver now passes uses the AMDGPU math libraries. [D119841](https://reviews.llvm.org/D119841)
*  Initial support for the `atomic compare` compare-and-swap operation. [D118632](https://reviews.llvm.org/D118632)


## External Compilers

### LLPC

*  The [SPIR-V `DontInline` function control mask](https://www.khronos.org/registry/SPIR-V/specs/unified1/SPIRV.html#_function_control) is not longer translated to the LLVM `noinline` attribute. This is to prepare for the changes the LLVM `noinline` callsite attribute handling ([D119553](https://reviews.llvm.org/D119553)). [LLPC#1700](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/llpc/pull/1700)
*  Pipeline options hashing was refactored for correctness and testability. [LLPC#1677](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/llpc/pull/1677)
*  More work towards enabling the New Pass Manager by default. [LLPC#1682](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/llpc/pull/1682)


### oneAPI DPC++

#### CUDA/HIP support

##### Explicit SIMD

*  Added support for the dpas API [DPCPP#5637](https://github.com/intel/llvm/pull/5637) and named barrier APIs [DPCPP#5583](https://github.com/intel/llvm/pull/5583).
*  Enabled `op(vector, scalar)` variant of binary math functions. [DPCPP#5651](https://github.com/intel/llvm/pull/5651)

##### FPGA

*  Silenced unknown attribute warnings on host compilation. [DPCPP#5619](https://github.com/intel/llvm/pull/5619)

#### Misc
