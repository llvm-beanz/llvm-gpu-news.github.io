### Discussions

### Commits

*  New NVPTX intrinsics and builtins for CUDA PTX 6.5 and 7.0 matrix operations: `wmma.load`, `wmma.store`, `wmma.mma`, and `mma`. [D104847](https://reviews.llvm.org/D104847)
*  AMDGPU learned to optimize VGPR live-ranges in simple divergent if-else statements. [D102212](https://reviews.llvm.org/D102212)
*  New AMDGPU target: gfx1035. [D104804](https://reviews.llvm.org/D104804)
*  AMDGPU gfx90a memory model has been updated. [D105137](https://reviews.llvm.org/D105137)
*  New 224-bit vector types for AMDGPU. These map to `v7i32`/`v7f32`, while existing 192-bit types to newly added `v3i64`/`v3f64`/`v6i32`/`v6f32`. [D104622](https://reviews.llvm.org/D104622)
*  The `ReplaceLDS` AMDGPU pass is now disabled by default in preparation to later remove the code. [D104962](https://reviews.llvm.org/D104962)

## MLIR

### Discussions

### Commits

*  New NVPTX ops for warp synchronous matrix operations for the GPU and NNVM dialects. [D95330](https://reviews.llvm.org/D95330), [D95331](https://reviews.llvm.org/D95331), [D105175](https://reviews.llvm.org/D105175)

## OpenMP (Target Offloading)

### Discussions

### Commits

*  Multiple globalization improvements:
    *  GPU memory globalization got simplified. The old implementation in the frontend that emulated standard CPU stack sharing is now replaced with a single allocation command, mimicking an `alloca` instruction for variables that must be shared between threads. [D97680](https://reviews.llvm.org/D97680), [D97818](https://reviews.llvm.org/D97818)
    *  OpenMP device routines will be internalized to facilitate interprocedural optimizations. [D102824](https://reviews.llvm.org/D102824)
    *  The number of Attributor iterations got doubled from 64 to 128 on the GPU target. [D104920](https://reviews.llvm.org/D104920)
    *  Remaining globalization optimizations will be now reported as missed remarks instead of analysis remarks. [D104735](https://reviews.llvm.org/D104735)
*  `clang-offload-bundler` can now unbundle archives containing bundled object files into device-specific archives. [D93525](https://reviews.llvm.org/D93525)


## External Compilers

### LLPC

*  LLPC can now generate out-of-bounds checks for scratch accesses (stack variables). [LLPC#1260](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/llpc/pull/1260)
*  New utilities for iterating over enums using C++ iterators and ranges. [LLPC#1273](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/llpc/pull/1273), [LLPC#1299](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/llpc/pull/1299)
