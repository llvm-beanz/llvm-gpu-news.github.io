*  The first GPU runtime specific call folding has been pushed [D105787](https://reviews.llvm.org/D105787), though there are issues still to be resolved right now. Folding of more runtime calls is already prepared (e.g., [D106154](https://reviews.llvm.org/D106154), [D106033](https://reviews.llvm.org/D106033)).
*  OpenMP-Opt will now emit more concise remarks with ID tags [D105939](https://reviews.llvm.org/D105939). The OpenMP documentation does describe these remarks in detail, with examples and mitigation strategies where applicable [D106018](https://reviews.llvm.org/D106018).
