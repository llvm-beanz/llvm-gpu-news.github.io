## Industry News and Conference Talks


##  LLVM and Clang

### Discussions

*  Discussion on the 'Abstracting over SSA form IRs to implement generic analyses' RFC has seen some new activity. Sameer Sahasrabuddhe [shared their perspective](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2021-March/149523.html) and identified that the main issue is that LLVM IR/MIR basic blocks do not explicitly track their successors and predecessors. Nicolai HÃ¤hnle [clarified what the most important decisions are](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2021-March/149560.html) to move the proposal forward. In addition, Nicolai noted that changing the in-memory representation of basic blocks to contain predecessor and successor vectors would allow terminator instruction to refer to those, and potentially result in reduced memory usage.

### Commits

*  [AMDGPU PAL usage documentation was updated.](https://reviews.llvm.org/D93125)
