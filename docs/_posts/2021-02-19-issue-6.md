We welcome your feedback and suggestions. Let us know if we missed anything interesting, or want us to bring attention to your (sub)project, revisions under review, or proposals. Please see the bottom of the page for details on how to submit suggestions and contribute.


## Industry News and Conference Talks
*  Vulkan, a cross-platform graphics API, is [five years old now](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Vulkan-Turns-Five-Years-Old).
*  In another Apple M1 GPU tinkering effort, Dougall Johnson published an in-progress doc attempting to [explain the M1 GPU architecture](https://dougallj.github.io/applegpu/docs.html). The project [repository contains various tools](https://github.com/dougallj/applegpu), including an assembler, disassembler, emulator, and a test suite.

### Commits

*  NVVM/ROCDL kernel function conversions [now rely on](https://reviews.llvm.org/D96591) target-specific attributes for better control.
*  NVVM/ROCDL to LLVM IR conversions [now adopt](https://reviews.llvm.org/D96592) the interface-based LLVM translation.
*  In SPIR-V dialect, more [types](https://reviews.llvm.org/D96169) and [ops](https://reviews.llvm.org/D96527) were defined to support graphics use cases.
*  More [patterns](https://reviews.llvm.org/D96042) were added to convert vector ops to SPIR-V ops.

### Mesa
*  llvmpipe, a CPU OpenGL implementation, landed [support for more SPIR-V extensions](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/8972), bringing it closer to full GL4.6 support.

### SYCL
*  Khronos released the final specification of the [SYCL 2020 spec](https://www.khronos.org/blog/sycl-2020-what-do-you-need-to-know). SYCL 2020 is based on C++17 and contains [over 40 new features](https://www.khronos.org/news/press/khronos-releases-sycl-2020-final-specification), including Unified Shared Memory, built-in parallel reduction operations, atomic operations with C++ atomics semantics.
