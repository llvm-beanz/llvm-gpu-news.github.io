* NVVM/ROCDL kernel function conversisons [now rely on](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/4c4876c314577e253a198ca3868b26fd35ec8a6e) target-specific attributes for better control.
* NVVM/ROCDL to LLVM IR conversions [now adopt](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/176379e0c8f9dbde2b357fb3b6a6802b83282e71) the interface-based LLVM translation.
* In SPIR-V dialect, more [types](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/2ef24139fcc1b48da4e2b86704611e017e3a0e7a) and [ops](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/7742620620b9e62476abc4aedfa5e14ea8336ad1) were defined to support graphics use cases.
* More [patterns](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/9f622b3d5d6aa21ca28a3a06a27434cedec98fc9) were added to convert vector ops to SPIR-V ops.
