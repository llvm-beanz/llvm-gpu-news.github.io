## Industry News and Conference Talks


##  LLVM and Clang

### Discussions

### Commits

*  Clang driver for HIP will [detect ROCm installations built by Spack](https://reviews.llvm.org/D97340). [Spack is a package manager for supercomputers](https://spack.io/), used in the HPC community.
*  Clang options [`-munsafe-fp-atomics`](https://reviews.llvm.org/D97967) and [`-mconstructor-aliases`](https://reviews.llvm.org/D97959) will be off by default on HIP. They do not work with AMDGPU.

## MLIR

### Discussions

### Commits

*  A few patches landed into the SPIR-V dialect to improve op naming consistency.


## OpenMP (Target Offloading)

### Discussions
 
*  We are working towards the optimization of "globalized" locals in OpenMP target regions ([D97680](https://reviews.llvm.org/D97680)), this is supposed to get us `-fopenmp-cuda-mode` performance while preserving OpenMP semantics.

### Commits

*  The OpenMP subproject is now [clang-formatted](https://reviews.llvm.org/D97088)
*  Various bugs have been fixed, including but not limited to: 
   *  [PR49334](https://llvm.org/PR49334): [fix](https://reviews.llvm.org/D97329),
   *  [PR49250](https://llvm.org/PR49250): [fix](https://reviews.llvm.org/D97012).

## External Compilers

### LLPC

### Mesa

*  lavapipe, a CPU Vulkan implementation, can now [run the `vkcube` 'Hello World' application on Windows](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7208#note_808941).
