##  LLVM and Clang

### Discussions

*  David Airlie is working on bringing back the Mesa OpenCL 3.0 support and [ran into issues with the SPIR target always enabling all CL optional extensions](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-dev/2021-July/068522.html). Anastasia Stulova noted that [SPIR was originally added as a device agnostic-target](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-dev/2021-July/068526.html). However, for Mesa/clover, it is [desirable to provide Clang a concrete device](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-dev/2021-July/068527.html) and the list of supported extensions.
*  [Frank Winter asked](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2021-July/151826.html) about adding support for the [NVSHMEM](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvshmem) API for GPU clusters to the NVPTX backend. There are no replies as of writing.

### Commits

*  The first GPU runtime specific call folding has been pushed [D105787](https://reviews.llvm.org/D105787), though there are issues still to be resolved right now. Folding of more runtime calls is already prepared (e.g., [D106154](https://reviews.llvm.org/D106154), [D106033](https://reviews.llvm.org/D106033)).
*  OpenMP-Opt will now emit more concise remarks with ID tags [D105939](https://reviews.llvm.org/D105939). The OpenMP documentation does describe these remarks in detail, with examples and mitigation strategies where applicable [D106018](https://reviews.llvm.org/D106018).
