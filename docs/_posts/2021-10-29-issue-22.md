#### CUDA/HIP support

- Added Windows platform support for CUDA back-end
- Fixed `mul_hi` and `frexp` math functions implementation for CUDA back-end
- Improved compiler diagnostics for missing libspirv library for CUDA and HIP back-ends
- Add `get_sub_group_local_id()` to HIP back-end

#### SYCL 2020 support

- Improved diagnostics for invalid kernel names
- Added definitions for missing feature test macros
- Fixed a few bugs in specialization constants implementation
- Remove program class and related APIs and `half` type declared in the global namespace

#### Non-standard extensions

- Improved printf support on devices w/o doubles support
- Added support for using std::tuple on Intel devices
- Added support for EXT_ONEAPI_max_work_groups extension adding new device information descriptors: max_global_work_groups and max_work_groups
- A number of improvements for Explicit SIMD feature for Intel GPU device including fixes for SLM gather/scatter, adding support for __esimd_svm_block_ld intrinsic and more

#### Upstream to LLVM

- Added support for 'sycl_special_class' attribute to address comments from https://reviews.llvm.org/D71016.
