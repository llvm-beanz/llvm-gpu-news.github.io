## Industry News and Conference Talks


##  LLVM and Clang

### Discussions
*  Johannes Doerfert asks about [NVPTX support for llvm math functions](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2021-March/149117.html) (e.g., `llvm.sin`). NVPTX does not provide `libc` and `libm`, thought some math functions are implemented through the `libdevice` bitcode module. A solution would be to teach Clang or the LLVM middleend how to match `__nv_*` functions to the LLVM ones. Johannes [implemented a prototype](https://reviews.llvm.org/D98516) that adds such function mapping support through LLVM IR attributes.
*  Jay Foad expressed interest in [using llvm-mca for AMDGPU](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2021-March/149068.html) and asked about the difference between `MicroOpBufferSize=0/1`. Based on the response from Andrew Trick, Jay implemented a patch that adds [llvm-mca support for in-order CPUs](https://reviews.llvm.org/D98356).
*  Konrad Trifunovic [summarized the discussion on upstreaming a SPIR-V backend](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2021-March/149175.html) and shared a rough plan with short and long-term objectives.
