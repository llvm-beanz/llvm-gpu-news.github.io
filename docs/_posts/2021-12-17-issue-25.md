#### CUDA/HIP support

* Added HIP backend support to [filter selector](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/sycl/sycl/doc/extensions/FilterSelector/FilterSelector.adoc) extension.
* Fixed infinite loop when parallel_for range exceeds `INT_MAX`.
* Fixed platform query for USM allocation information.
* Improved performance on CUDA backed by reducing runtime overhead on event handling and using more efficient implementation for barrier and other synchronization built-in functions.

#### SYCL 2020 support

* Switched blocking USM free for OpenCL GPU devices.
* Fixed support for classes implicitly converted from items in `parallel_for`.

#### Non-standard extensions

* Added support for HW threads per EU device query.
* Added implementation of discard_events extension enabling optimization of queue operations.
* Added experimental FPGA latency control feature.
* ESIMD: Add support for an arbitrary number of elements to `simd::copy_from/to`.
* Fixed `bfloat16` construction from integer.

#### Misc

* Improved runtime library performance by reducing overhead of XPTI instrumentation.
* Made initialization of host task thread pool thread-safe.
* Multiple GitHub Actions continuous system improvements:
  * libclc testing added to regular validation.
  * Build of HIP and CUDA back-ends enabled in nightly Docker containers.
* Improved runtime error diagnostics by handling `ZE_RESULT_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT` and out-of-memory Level Zero error codes.
