Welcome to LLVM GPU News, a bi-weekly newsletter on all the GPU things under the LLVM umbrella.
This issue covers the period from February 25 to March 18, 2022.

We welcome your feedback and suggestions. Let us know if we missed anything interesting, or want us to bring attention to your (sub)project, revisions under review, or proposals. Please see [the bottom of the page](https://llvm-gpu-news.github.io/about/) for details on how to submit suggestions and contribute.


## Industry News and Community Events

*  Nicolai HÃ¤hnle [blogged about convergence control intrinsics](http://nhaehnle.blogspot.com/2022/03/a-new-type-of-convergence-control.html).
*  The Khronos group released the [Vulkan SC 1.0 standard for safety-critical graphics and compute](https://www.khronos.org/news/press/khronos-releases-vulkan-safety-critical-1.0-specification-to-deliver-safety-critical-graphics-compute). The standard is [aimed at industries like automotive and avionics](https://www.khronos.org/blog/vulkan-sc-overview). One notable difference compared to regular Vulkan is that Vulkan SC does not support online (runtime) pipeline compilation and all shader/pipeline compilations happen offline (ahead-of-time).


##  LLVM and Clang

### Discussions

*  [Chris B](https://discourse.llvm.org/u/beanz/summary) posted an RFC on ['Adding HLSL and DirectX support to Clang & LLVM'](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-adding-hlsl-and-directx-support-to-clang-llvm/60783). The plan assumes landing the implementation piece-by-piece, instead of directly merging with the [DXC codebase](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler). HLSL can target two intermediate languages: DXIL (based on LLVM IR 3.7) and SPIR-V. The proposal was also [discussed in the 3rd LLVM GPU Working Group meeting on March 18](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m_oSe1HwtWdQ2JUmMRTAVHbUS7Dv4MRsqptiYcgK6iI/edit#heading=h.a3x27pw0400w). An [initial stack of revisions](https://reviews.llvm.org/D122087) is already available on Phabricator.
