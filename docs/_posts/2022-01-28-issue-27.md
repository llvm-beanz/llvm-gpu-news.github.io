Welcome to LLVM GPU News, a bi-weekly newsletter on all the GPU things under the LLVM umbrella.
This issue covers the period from January 14 to January 27 2022.

We welcome your feedback and suggestions. Let us know if we missed anything interesting, or want us to bring attention to your (sub)project, revisions under review, or proposals. Please see [the bottom of the page](https://llvm-gpu-news.github.io/about/) for details on how to submit suggestions and contribute.


## Industry News and Conferences

*  [Alyssa Rosenzweig](https://rosenzweig.io/) blogged about ['Writing an open source GPU driver â€“ without the hardware'](https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2022/01/27/writing-an-open-source-gpu-driver-without-the-hardware/). The post describes various testing techniques that allowed them to implement driver/compiler support for 'Valhall' ARM GPUs before they were able to test it on a real Linux system: 'It only took me a few days after getting the hardware and a serial cable to pass hundreds of tests on the new architecture. Months of speculatively developing the driver came with a huge pay off.'


##  LLVM and Clang

### Discussions

*  Artem Belevich [proposed to change the NVPTX calling convention](https://llvm.discourse.group/t/nvptx-calling-convention-for-aggregate-arguments-passed-by-value/5881) for aggregate function arguments passed by value. This would make Clang pass aggregate values directly as opposed to via `byval` pointers. The motivation is to allow SROA (the Scalar Replacement of Aggregates pass) to eliminate more local copies. 
*  Vasileios Porpodas posted an RFC on ['Spill2Reg: Selectively replace spills to stack with spills to vector registers'](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2022-January/154782.html). Although the optimization was primarily evaluated on x86 (Skylake), Madhur Amilkanthwar noted that the [AMDGPU backend has a similar pass](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2022-January/154806.html).

### Commits
