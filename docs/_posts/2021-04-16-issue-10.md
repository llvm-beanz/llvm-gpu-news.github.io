Welcome to LLVM GPU News, a bi-weekly newsletter on all the GPU things under the LLVM umbrella.
This issue covers the period from April 2 to April 15 2021.

We welcome your feedback and suggestions. Let us know if we missed anything interesting, or want us to bring attention to your (sub)project, revisions under review, or proposals. Please see the bottom of the page for details on how to submit suggestions and contribute.


## Industry News and Conference Talks

*  Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference (GTC) was [live this week](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gtc/).
*  Registration for the SIGGRAPH 2021 conference (virtual, August 9-13) [is open](https://s2021.siggraph.org/register/).
*  Vulkan 1.2.175 has been published. New notable extensions include [video encode and decode](https://www.khronos.org/blog/an-introduction-to-vulkan-video). You can share you feedback under the [Vulkan Video GitHub issue](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/issues/1497).
*  Heterogeneous Parallel Virtual Machine (HPVM) v1.0 has been [released](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2021-April/149693.html). HPVM is a retargetable compi-fgpu-flush-denormals-to-zeroler infrastructure that targets CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and accelerators. This release is based on LLVM 9.0.

### Discussions

### Commits

*  The work on supporting AMDGPU GFX90* continues:
   -  GFX90a memory model [got updated](https://reviews.llvm.org/D100070). This includes documentation changes.
   -  GFX90a code path will [reject assembly using the `scc` bit](https://reviews.llvm.org/D100069).
   -  GFX90c code object v2 [is added](https://reviews.llvm.org/D100126) for backwards compatibility.
*  NVPTX learned to [avoid some copying](https://reviews.llvm.org/D99979) in function argument lowering.
*  CUDA/HIP option `-fcuda-flush-denormals-to-zero` [has been renamed](https://reviews.llvm.org/D99688) to `-fgpu-flush-denormals-to-zero`.

### Commits

*  SPIR-V conversion now [allows](https://reviews.llvm.org/D100059) explicitly controlling bitwidth emulation for bitwidth unsupported in the target environment.
*  A few fixes [landed](https://reviews.llvm.org/D100335) in SPIR-V conversion to [handle](https://reviews.llvm.org/D100337) dynamic ranked `memref` better.
*  A few utility functions are [added]( https://reviews.llvm.org/D99725) in SPIR-V conversion for creating push constant blocks.
*  Boolean `memref`s are now properly [handled](https://reviews.llvm.org/D99724) when converting to SPIR-V.



## OpenMP (Target Offloading)

### Discussions

*  Kai Plociennik is asking about creating a [static library containing OpenMP offloading](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2021-April/149870.html) code. There are no replies as of writing.
