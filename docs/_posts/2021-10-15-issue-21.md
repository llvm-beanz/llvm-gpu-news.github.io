Welcome to LLVM GPU News, a bi-weekly newsletter on all the GPU things under the LLVM umbrella.
This issue covers the period from September 25 to October 14 2021.

We welcome your feedback and suggestions. Let us know if we missed anything interesting, or want us to bring attention to your (sub)project, revisions under review, or proposals. Please see the bottom of the page for details on how to submit suggestions and contribute.


## Industry News and Conferences
*  [PoCL 1.8 was released](https://github.com/pocl/pocl/releases/tag/v1.8) and comes with Clang/LLVM 13.0 support and improved support for SPIR/SPIR-V on CUDA. [PoCL is a portable open source implementation of the OpenCL standard](http://portablecl.org/) for CPUs, NVIDA and AMD GPUs, and TCE ASIPs.


##  LLVM and Clang

### Discussions

*  [Nicholas Wilson asked about the signature of NVPTX surface intrinsics](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2021-October/153239.html) which have `i8` in name but return `i16` results. There are no replies at the time of writing.

## OpenMP (Target Offloading)

### Discussions

*  Matthew Grismer is interested in [OpenMP offloading for Apple Silicon](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2021-October/153294.html). [Johannes Doerfert was not aware of any ongoing efforts](https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2021-October/153306.html) and mentioned codegen support for these series of GPUs as a prerequisite.
