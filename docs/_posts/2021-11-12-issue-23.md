### LLPC

*  Middle-end now support the New Pass Manager but still default to the Legacy one. [LLPC#1459](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/llpc/pull/1459)

### oneAPI DPC++

#### CUDA/HIP support

* Added initial support for the [Tensorcore matrix extension](https://github.com/intel/llvm/pull/4695)
* CUDA and HIP plugins were renamed to align with the SYCL 2020 specification
* Fixed preprocessor-only compilation mode for the NVPTX target

#### SYCL 2020 support

* Implemented property traits
* Fixed interoperability kernel API returning invalid kernel bundle
* Improved performance of `sycl::queue::submit()` for commands without dependencies

#### Non-standard extensions

* Fixed a bug in SVM gather/scatter emulation on host for ESIMD extension
* Implemented `no_offset` compile-time accessor property
* Enhanced matrix extension specification with JIT support for AMX and DPAS ISA
* The `SPV_INTEL_hw_thread_queries` extension support was enabled by default

#### Misc

* Release notes for September [were published](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/sycl/sycl/ReleaseNotes.md#september21-release-notes)
