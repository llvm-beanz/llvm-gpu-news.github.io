Welcome to the fourth issue of LLVM GPU News, a bi-weekly newsletter on all the GPU things under the LLVM umbrella.
This issue covers the period from January 8 to January 21 2020.

LLVM GPU News gained a new section: OpenMP Target Offloading, maintained by Johannes Doerfert.

We welcome your feedback and suggestions. Let us know if we missed anything interesting, or want us to bring attention to your (sub)project, revisions under review, or proposals. Please see the bottom of the page for details on how to submit suggestions and contribute.

## Industry News and Conference Talks


##  LLVM and Clang

### Discussions

### Commits

## MLIR

### Discussions

* Lenny Guo [expressed intention](https://llvm.discourse.group/t/generate-spirv-binary-from-mlir-dialect-kernels-to-run-it-on-ocl-runtime/2501/4) to work on OpenCL conversions via SPIR-V and bring up an mlir-opencl-runner.

### Commits

* The SPIR-V dialect now knows traits like [`SignedOp`](https://reviews.llvm.org/D94896), [`UnsignedOp`](https://reviews.llvm.org/D94068), and [`UsableInSpecConstantOp`](https://reviews.llvm.org/D94288) to process ops in these categories uniformly.
* `spv.SpecConstantOperation` is fully supported now, including serialization and deserialization.  


## OpenMP (Target Offloading)

### Discussions

* Discussions usually happen on the mailing list (openmp-dev@lists.llvm.org) or in our weekly ["OpenMP in LLVM" meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tz8WFN13n7yJ-SCE0Qjqf9LmjGUw0dWO9Ts1ss4YOdg/edit?usp=sharing), feel free to join in!
* The LLVM/OpenMP documentation has been [online](https://openmp.llvm.org/docs/index.html) for a few weeks. Initial content is there but FAQ and other sections are still very much empty; we are looking for volunteers and topics.
* The memory management APIs proposed for OpenMP 6.0, i.a., to allocate managed memory, they might find their way into LLVM in the (very) near future (potentially opt-in).


### Commits

* The `declare mapper` API was the last part of data mapping that did not transfer source information to the runtime (location and name of the mapped objects). This was [changed now](https://reviews.llvm.org/D94806) which will cause [`LIBOMPTARGET_INFO`](https://openmp.llvm.org/docs/design/Runtimes.html#libomptarget-info) to display plenty of useful information about mapped objects.
* The [second patch](https://reviews.llvm.org/D94855) for the OpenMP target profiling allows us to trace multiple threads that offloading concurrently. See the documentation for [`LIBOMPTARGET_PROFILE`](https://openmp.llvm.org/docs/design/Runtimes.html#libomptarget-profile).
* Support for an PTX device runtime [has been dropped](https://reviews.llvm.org/D94725) in favor of the superior way, using an LLVM-IR device runtime. The latter is now easy to build [OpenMP offloading capable compiler](https://openmp.llvm.org/docs/SupportAndFAQ.html#q-how-to-build-an-openmp-offload-capable-compiler), simply move `openmp` from the enabled projects to the enabled runtimes.
* The `nowait` support for `omp target` directives via ["hidden helper threads"](https://tianshilei.me/wp-content/uploads/concurrent-lcpc2020.pdf) was [upstreamed](https://reviews.llvm.org/D77609). Given some problems encountered afterwards it might need to be refined slightly though.
* (In-review) [Driver support for OpenMP offloading onto AMD GPUs.](https://reviews.llvm.org/D94961)
* (In-review) A series of patches is underway to allow building the device runtime in pure OpenMP + C++. An overview of the effort can be found [here](https://reviews.llvm.org/D94745).
